## 🚀 Projects

### 🔁 Palindromes Filter
Filters a list of words to find palindromes between 4–15 characters. Displays:
- Word length
- Number of total words
- Number of palindromes
- The palindromes themselves

### 🔎 Port Scanner
Reads randomly generated IPs and ports, scans using socket connections, and displays timeout durations. Simulates the behavior of basic port scanning with simple output handling.

### 🔐 SSN Generator
Generates randomized Social Security Numbers (SSNs) based on user-defined quantity (1–100). Ensures no duplicates, validates input, and prompts for repeat generations.

### 📝 Character Search in Text File
Analyzes a text file for total words and lets users search for specific characters (A-Z). Sorts and displays all words that contain the selected character.

### 🔓 Combination Lock Brute Force Simulation
Simulates brute-forcing a combination lock based on user-defined number of rings and seconds per try. Outputs time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds to crack the lock.

### 🔑 Password Validator & Generator
Generates secure passwords based on user input (length: 12–20 chars). Ensures each password includes uppercase letters and special characters. Allows user to create multiple passwords and validates length constraints.
